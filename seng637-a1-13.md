# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The exploratory testing approach focuses on navigating the ATM system through its most common real world use case scenarios. This method emphasizes evaluating the system from a typical user’s perspective, making standard workflows and frequent transaction paths the primary means of identifying defects. In addition, boundary conditions and common edge cases will be tested to assess how the system behaves under slightly stressed or unusual conditions.
Using the limited documentation in regards to the ATM requirements we found the common workflows in which we would traverse. We would be acting as a user who would insert a card and withdraw, deposit, transfer funds, check balance, etc.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

We performed the pair testing by dividing and splitting up tasks appropriately between different testers, both at a high level and low level of testing. We seperated the exploratory, manual, and regression testing into different phases in which each tester would take on a phase. Then within each high level testing phase, we would have another tester be assigned to bugs for them to review and complete.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

There weren't too many difficulties surrouding the testing process as we were able to identify and see the fixes of version 1.0 in version 1.1. The challenges that we faced stemmed around us needing to understand the fully the requirements of the ATM. There were a few cases where we may have understood a feature that was purposefully built into the system as a bug or an issue. This allowed us to wrap our heads around the deep importance of early documentation in building software. It will not only be needed for building out the system better but also to better maintain the system in the future.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The lab was made well to allow us to learn through a hands on method. This was more effective in understanding the different sections that are needed for properly testing a system.
