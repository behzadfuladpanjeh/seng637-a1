# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The exploratory testing approach focuses on navigating the ATM system through its most common real world use case scenarios. This method emphasizes evaluating the system from a typical user’s perspective, making standard workflows and frequent transaction paths the primary means of identifying defects. In addition, boundary conditions and common edge cases will be tested to assess how the system behaves under slightly stressed or unusual conditions.
Using the limited documentation in regards to the ATM requirements we found the common workflows in which we would traverse. We would be acting as a user who would insert a card and withdraw, deposit, transfer funds, check balance, etc.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

For this lab, we had to utilize both exploratory and manual functional testing. Exploratory testing is where a user randomly explores the functionality of the program, whereas manual functional testing requires a systematic approach. The systematic approach requires the tester to think of all the different functionalities of buttons and input fields to see if it behaves as intended.  

For exploratory testing, we found that it was very effective in discovering edge case logic and spelling mistakes in the UI, which was not a requirement in manual functional testing. The manual functional testing would ask if the message would show but not specify if the message was correctly written. For example, BR-2 had a typo "Wood you like", and another example would be testing multiple transactions, from transaction one to two; it would skip the two and output three. The positive of exploratory testing is that the tester is not confiding a list of potential issues; it is up to the tester to explore bugs that were not thought of in manual functional testing. The downside of exploratory testing is that it does not guarantee that the tester will cover the full requirements of testing.  

In the manual functional test, there was a scripted test that was provided in appendix C of the assignment. The scripted test was made to ensure all the core business requirements, so that each iteration of the program can be tested in the same manner to check if fixing one issue did not break up another part of the program. This process is highly effective for repeatability and to compare two different versions; however, this process is very time consuming, especially when a program is bigger than the program we tested. 

In conclusion, we learned that both types of testing are required because they complement each other's weaknesses. 

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

We performed the pair testing by dividing and splitting up tasks appropriately between different testers, both at a high level and low level of testing. We seperated the exploratory, manual, and regression testing into different phases in which each tester would take on a phase. Then within each high level testing phase, we would have another tester be assigned to bugs for them to review and complete.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

There weren't too many difficulties surrouding the testing process as we were able to identify and see the fixes of version 1.0 in version 1.1. The challenges that we faced stemmed around us needing to understand the fully the requirements of the ATM. There were a few cases where we may have understood a feature that was purposefully built into the system as a bug or an issue. This allowed us to wrap our heads around the deep importance of early documentation in building software. It will not only be needed for building out the system better but also to better maintain the system in the future.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The lab was made well to allow us to learn through a hands on method. This was more effective in understanding the different sections that are needed for properly testing a system.
